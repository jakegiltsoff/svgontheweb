        <h6>Introduction</h6>
        <p>We live in the age of pixels. As designers &amp; developers of the web, pixels can be both our friends and our enemies. We want everything to look nice and sharp for anyone who uses any of the websites we work on, but we need to keep file sizes down for performance. There is pretty much only one way to go with icons, logos and illustrations on the web — <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>. Scalable Vector Graphics can look crisp at all screen resolutions, can have super small file sizes, and can be easily edited and modified.</p>

        <p>This guide aims to give a practical overview of how you can use <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s on your websites — with some tips and tricks along the way to get the most out of them.</p>

        <p>Scalable Vector Graphics are an <span class="small-caps">XML</span> based markup that can contain two-dimensional vectors. The vectors can be simple shapes, paths, or well just about anything you can do in Illustrator. It’s an image format that has more in common with a web page that it does with a <span class="small-caps">JPEG</span>. <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> is much more powerful than other image formats we can use on the web as we can manipulate them with code (either in our text editor or with <span class="small-caps">CSS / JS</span>).</p>

      <div class="column column--main column--left">
        <p>Preparing an <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> for use on the web is a simple process and no more complicated that exporting a <span class="small-caps">JPEG</span> or <span class="small-caps">PNG</span>. Work as you typically would in your preferred vector graphics editor (Illustrator, Sketch, Inkscape [free], etc [or even Photoshop if you use shape layers]) with the graphic at the size that you expect to use it. I’ll explain a few things I do using Illustrator as that is what I typically use, but the same principles apply to any software. You’ll probably want to convert any text to outlines as it most likely will not show in the correct font unless you plan on styling them with a web font you are using on the page (which you can do!). Don’t worry about expanding all your objects to solid shapes, particularly if you have strokes as you may want to manipulate these on the page and expanding them typically doesn’t make the file size any smaller. Any names you put on layers / groups will be added in to the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> as an ID on that element. This can be handy for styling, but will add a little to the overall file size.</p>

        <p>To export, check that the design is sitting in an area of whole pixels (i.e. not <span class="lining-numerals">23.3px &times; 86.8px</span>) otherwise it may not actually be crisp and then crop the artboard around it. You can do this in Illustrator with <code>Object > Artboards > Fit to Artwork Bounds</code>. Next hit <code>save as</code> and choose <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> and use the default settings. You can do some optimising here, but it isn’t really worth it as we will be post-processing them to optimise and any time spend playing with these settings is wasted.</p>

        <h3 class="delta">Tips for smaller file sizes</h3>

        <p class="caption sidenote">(See the <a href="#resources">resources</a> for external article links)</p>

        <p>There are a number of good articles on <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> optimisation on the web which offer a wealth of knowledge on this subject, but I would like to share a few tips and tricks that I have found to be most effective and useful for me. They don’t take much extra work and can be easily added in to your workflow.</p>

        <p>To keep your <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s as small as possible you effectively want to remove anything unnecessary. The most well known and best (at least I think so) tool to post process <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s is <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo" class="small-caps">SVGO</a>. This strips out all the code that isn’t needed — note: remember to be careful when using this if you plan to manipulate with <span class="small-caps">CSS / JS</span> as it can sometimes over-optimise your files making them harder to do what you planned to with them later on. A very handy thing with <span class="small-caps">SVGO</span> is it can be added to your build process so it is automatic (or you can use a <span class="small-caps"><a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui">GUI</a></span> to do it yourself if you prefer).</p>

        <p>Taking things a step further in ‘removing anything unnecessary’ we can do some more in the graphics editor. First you want to make sure you are using as few paths / shapes as possible to achieve what you want and also that there are as few points on these paths as possible. You want to combine and simplify anything that you can. Then you want to remove as many points from your paths as possible. <a href="http://www.astutegraphics.com/software/vectorscribe/">VectorScribe</a> is an Illustrator plugin that has as part of it a <code>Smart Remove Brush Tool</code> — this allows you to remove points whilst still keeping the overall shape the same.</p>

        <p class="caption sidenote">Pre optimisation</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/2point.png" alt="Pre optimisation"></p>

        <p class="caption sidenote">Smart Remove Brush Tool removed point</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/1point.png" alt="Post optimisation"></p>

        <p>Next you are going to want to zoom in. In Illustrator you will want to enable the Pixel Preview with <code>View > Pixel Preview</code> and take a look at where your path points sit. For the smallest file sizes you want these to sit on the pixel grid (i.e. at whole pixel values). This takes a little bit of time to snap them all in place but is worth the extra bit of effort as this also ensures the sharpest rendering (notice how before you can end up with some half-pixel areas).</p>

        <p class="caption sidenote">Points off pixels</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/nosnap.png" alt="Points off pixels"></p>

        <p class="caption sidenote">Pixel snapped</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/snap.png" alt="Pixel snapped"></p>

        <p>If you have two (or more) shapes that align you will want to remove any unneeded overlap. A thing to look out for is they can appear to have a thin white line between them even if the paths align, so sometimes you need to overlap them a little to prevent this. Note: in <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> the <code>z-index</code> is defined by the order they appear in the file with the bottom being the highest, so put the top shape at the bottom of the file in the code.</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/whiteline.png" alt="Post optimisation"></p>

        <p>Last but not least, one thing that is often forgotten about, remember to enable gzip compression for <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s on your websites in the <code>.htaccess</code> file.</p>

        <pre><code>AddType image/svg+xml svg svgz
&lt;IfModule mod_deflate.c&gt;
    &lt;IfModule mod_filter.c&gt;
        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE "image/svg+xml" \
                                      "text/css" \
                                      "text/html" \
                                      "text/javascript"
                                      ... etc
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>

        <hr>

        <p>As an example of how effective these techniques can be, I took the original <a href="http://breakingborde.rs/">Breaking Borders</a> logo and optimised it thusly: re-sized it to as large as it needed to be, tidied the paths, removed as many points as possible, moved the points to whole pixel values, removed as much of the overlapping area as possible, and put it through <span class="small-caps">SVGO</span>.</p>

        <h4 class="zeta">Original: 1,413b</h4>

        <img src="/assets/img/bblogo.svg" alt="Breaking Borders Logo" height="65" width="68" class="bb-logo-example">

        <img src="/assets/img/bblogo-optim.svg" alt="Breaking Borders Logo" height="65" width="68" class="bb-logo-example">

        <p><b>All in all that makes it <span class="lining-numerals">~71%</span> smaller (and <span class="lining-numerals">~83%</span> smaller if gzipped)</b></p>

        <p><span class="small-caps highlight">ADDITION:</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/robsterlini">Rob Sterlini</a> pointed out that as the ‘b’ is repeated you could probably use a <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element to repeat it which might make it smaller — and he was totally right.</p>

        <h4 class="zeta">Optimised further with &lt;use&gt;: 311b</h4>

        <p>If you do this to all the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s on a site it can really add up.</p>

        <p>When it comes to using <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s on the web there are a number of different ways you can go. Some of them have benefits which can be useful depending on what you would like to achieve and some of them are best to be avoided. If you want to just keep things basic to get the resolution independence and file size benefits you can reference the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> in an <code>img</code> or as a <code>background-image</code> in <span class="small-caps">CSS</span> just as you would any other image format.</p>

        <h4 class="epsilon">Img</h4>
        <p>Just as you would with any other image. You can also use <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s in a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element. Note that this method limits manipulation functionality.</p>

        <p>You can load <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. It does let you do most things, but I’m not sure it is the best method to use moving forward ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

        <p><code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> is meant to be used to integrate ‘an external application’ or ‘interactive content’. You can use it for <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s but yea probably just don’t.</p>

        <p><code>&lt;object&gt;</code> is pretty much the best option to use if you want to be able to manipulate an <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> without having to put it inline in your <span class="small-caps">HTML</span>.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" data="bblogo.svg"&gt;Your browser does not support SVGs&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre>

        <h4 class="epsilon">Inline</h4>
        <p>Putting your <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> code inline will save an <span class="small-caps">HTTP</span> request but it will mean the image isn’t cached by the browser.

        <p>If you want to get the most out of your <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s use <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>. Alternatively you can use them inline to save the <span class="small-caps">HTTP</span> request, but note that it will not be cached.

        <p>One of the great things with using an <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> is we can change how elements within it are styled using good old <span class="small-caps">CSS</span>. Say we have an orange icon and we want it to be blue on some pages, we can do that without having to make a new blue icon. Ideal.</p>

        <p>There are two ways we can change styles — inline in the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> and externally (i.e. within our stylesheet). To put styles inline, wrap them in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag and also within <code>&lt![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt;</code>. It’s best to do this as sometimes <span class="small-caps">XML</span> parsers can conflict with certain characters (i.e. <code>&gt;</code>). Even if you don’t have any funky characters in there now, it is best practice to use <code>CDATA</code> as some could be added at a later time and break all the things.</p>

        <p>Inline styles will mostly work in all implementations. <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>background-image</code> don’t support <span class="small-caps">CSS3</span> animations even if they are inline (see section on <a href="#animating">animations</a> for more). <code>background-image</code> doesn’t support inline media queries (see section on <a href="#mediaqueries">media queries</a> for more).</p>

        <p>If you want to use external styles, which are mostly much easier to work with and maintain, you can’t use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>background-image</code>. If you are using <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> you need to reference your stylesheet internally from the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> file (see code following). Remember: if you do this the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> will also not be able to know what its parent class is (i.e. the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>) so don’t try to use that in its styling. Inline <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s don’t need this added and therefore can be slightly easier to work with in this sense.</p>

        <p>My JavaScript knowledge is pretty minimal, so I’m just going to point out some basic tips on how you can use <span class="small-caps">JS</span> to change things in an <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>. If you want to embed your scripts within the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> file, remember to wrap them in <code>&lt![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt;</code> again to prevent parsing errors. Scripts will not run if you use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>background-image</code> as a security measure (i.e. to prevent potentially malicious code running on your page).</p>

        <p>When working with external <span class="small-caps">JS</span> (i.e. not embeded within the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> file), if you have your <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> inline you can target it as you would any other <span class="small-caps">DOM</span> element. If you use an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> you can target it with <code>contentDocument</code>. You can get much more creative than the following, but here is an example:</p>

        <p>When using images on the web in responsive designs there are two options you can use to style them, you can keep them at a fixed-size and adjust at breakpoints if needed, or allow them to resize with the page depending on their parent container.</p>

        <p>If they are a fixed size the only thing you need to be careful of is if you are using the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> as a <code>background-image</code> you need to make sure to include a <code>background-size</code> because browsers can get a bit confused and either crop it or shrink it, particularly if you are showing it at a different size to the actual size of the image.</p>

        <p>When implementing an <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> that can resize there are a couple of things to remember (again mostly with the <code>background-image</code> implementation) as outlined here:</p>

        <h2><a class="title" href="#animating">Animating</a></h2>
      </div>
      <div class="column column--main">
        <p>When it comes to animating <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s there are a few different options that we can use — <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> animation (based on the <span class="small-caps">SMIL</span> spec), <span class="small-caps">CSS3</span> animations, or <span class="small-caps">JS</span> animations. <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> animation and <span class="small-caps">CSS3</span> animations let you do most things you will want to do — with <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> animation being slightly more powerful in that it has control over a few extra things. JavaScript allows you to do some pretty complex animations relatively easily, especially with libraries such as <a href="http://snapsvg.io/">Snap.svg</a>. This is a little beyond my knowledge of JavaScript so I’ll let you check out their demos to see for yourself if that is the right option.</p>

        <p><span class="small-caps">SVG</span> animation is super powerful but I’m not going to go in to too much depth on it as to be honest I’ve not really ever used it. I can imagine it being useful for illustrations that you would like to have some nice animations happening with, but from a practical point of view not every project has the time or budget to spend on this. If you do, it is actually pretty simple to start playing around with and there are some <a href="#resources">great tutorials</a> online. Basically you can add a child element of <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code> to any paths and shapes in your <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s which will control the animations. The best thing about it is, it works in all implementation methods. Internet Explorer does not support <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> animation, however you can use a polyfill such as <a href="https://leunen.me/fakesmile/">FakeSmile</a> if you need it to work in <span class="small-caps">IE</span> too.</p>

        <p>Here’s a little demo to show you. Note: I’ve lightened the blue to make it easier to see the animation.</p>

        <p>You can create and use <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> sprites just as we typically do with <span class="small-caps">PNG</span>s and <code>background-image</code> to get the resolution benefits or you can take it a step further using the extra power we have with <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>. I’m not going to go in to too much depth here again as it does get pretty complex and I’ve never found a need to implement them personally. The benefit is getting all the power of <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> with fewer <span class="small-caps">HTTP</span> requests.</p>

        <p>There are two approaches you can take — in the first you define all the icons within <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> elements in the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> but hide them. Then reference each later when needed with a <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element referencing the <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> with <code>xlink:href="#id"</code>. The second uses the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> <code>viewbox</code> attribute to crop the artboard (area of the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> that shows) around a certain area. These are both quite advanced <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> uses so only worry about them if you want to use them.</p>

        <p>If you do want to learn how to implement these techniques please take a look at the links in the <a href="#resources">resources</a>, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan">Sara Soueidan’s</a> 24ways <a href="http://24ways.org/2014/an-overview-of-svg-sprite-creation-techniques/">article</a>.</p>

        <p>If you want to use an <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> sprite just as you would a <span class="small-caps">PNG</span> sprite with <span class="small-caps">CSS</span> it is worth noting that you will need to add the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes back in alongside the <code>viewBox</code> attribute in the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> code. During the optimising process these are typically removed because they aren’t usually needed. In this case however <span class="small-caps">IE9 &amp; 10</span> need them to be able to correctly crop to part of the image sprite. This is because those browsers take the width and height sizes specified in the <span class="small-caps">CSS</span> for the image size, but these are actually the sizes of the part of the image wanted (not the whole image). Confusing I know, but it is something I ran into recently.</p>

      <div class="column column--main">
        <p>A really cool thing about <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s is, if you use media queries in the styles you embed within the file, instead of them working from the viewport size they will work from the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s viewport size. Basically that means they have their own working implementation of element queries out of the box. Nice. This allows us to control how the <span class="small-caps">SVG</span> will look at whatever size it is shown.</p>

        <p>Imagine you are a big brand and you want people to use your logo correctly no matter what size it’s shown. Well you pretty much can! Just embed some media queries and you can change its formatting based on what size it is displayed at. This works with all implementations apart from <code>background-image</code> and in all browsers (note: <span class="small-caps">IE9–11</span> seem to ignore some breakpoints). Have a play with the slider below to see an example of how that could work:</p>

        <form oninput="getElementById('responsive-logo').setAttribute('width',value=slider.value);" style="min-height: 200px;">
          <input id="slider" type="range" min="30" max="335" value="335"></input>
          <br>
          <img id="responsive-logo" class="slider-image" src="/assets/img/bblogo-resp.svg" width="335" alt="svg">
        </form>
      </div>

  <section class="group group--10" id="fallbacks">

      </div>
      <div class="column column--main">
        <p>A word on fallbacks. <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>s are supported in all modern browsers. If you still have to support <span class="small-caps">IE8</span> then you will need to implement fallbacks, most likely in the form of <span class="small-caps">PNG</span>s. I’m not going to go in to this much because you probably shouldn’t be supporting <span class="small-caps">IE8</span> anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Anyway, if you do want fallbacks, basically things get pretty complicated pretty quickly as most things do with <span class="small-caps">SVG</span>. I would recommend to read this comprehensive article by <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliasBrain">Amelia Bellamy-Royds</a> on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-svg-fallbacks/">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>
